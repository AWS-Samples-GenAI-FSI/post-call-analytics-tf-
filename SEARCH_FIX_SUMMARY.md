# Search Functionality Fix Summary

## üêõ Issue Identified
The search functionality in the UI was returning no records even though the dashboard showed 1 call record.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
The problem was in the DynamoDB query structure in the search Lambda function:

1. **DynamoDB Table Structure**: The GSI1 index uses `GSI1PK` as the partition key and `GSI1SK` as the sort key
2. **Search Function Bug**: The search queries were using `TK` attribute in KeyConditionExpression, but `TK` is not the sort key of the GSI1 index
3. **Data Type Mismatch**: The search was using Number type for timestamps, but GSI1SK stores them as String

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Search Function (`tf-ui/lambda/src/search.js`)
- **Before**: Used `TK` attribute in KeyConditionExpression
- **After**: Changed to use `GSI1SK` attribute (the actual sort key)
- **Before**: Used Number type (`N`) for timestamp values
- **After**: Changed to String type (`S`) for consistency

### 2. Updated Post-Processing Function (`pca/pca-aws-sf-post-processing.py`)
- Ensured timestamp is stored in `GSI1SK` as String for proper querying
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `TK` attribute

## üìù Code Changes

### Search Function Changes:
```javascript
// OLD - Using TK (incorrect)
makeQuery("call", "TK BETWEEN :start AND :end", {
  ":start": { N: params.timestampFrom },
  ":end": { N: params.timestampTo }
})

// NEW - Using GSI1SK (correct)
makeQuery("call", "GSI1SK BETWEEN :start AND :end", {
  ":start": { S: params.timestampFrom },
  ":end": { S: params.timestampTo }
})
```

### Post-Processing Function:
- Confirmed GSI1SK is properly set with timestamp as String
- Maintained TK attribute for backward compatibility

## üöÄ Deployment
1. Updated Lambda function code for search functionality
2. Updated Lambda function code for post-processing
3. Functions deployed successfully to AWS

## ‚úÖ Expected Results
- Search functionality should now work correctly
- Date range searches will return proper results
- Job name searches will work as expected
- Sentiment and entity searches will function properly

## üéØ Testing Instructions
1. Go to your web interface: `https://d2c14r3jid41i8.cloudfront.net`
2. Navigate to the Search page
3. Try searching without any filters (should show all records)
4. Try searching with date ranges
5. Try searching by job name

## üîß Technical Details
- **DynamoDB Index**: GSI1 with GSI1PK (partition) and GSI1SK (sort)
- **Query Pattern**: Uses KeyConditionExpression on GSI1SK for timestamp filtering
- **Data Types**: String types for consistency across all search parameters
- **Lambda Functions Updated**:
  - `pca-stack-202507271145-ui-search`
  - `tf-pca-stack-202507271145-final-processing`

The search functionality should now work correctly and return your call records as expected! üéâ
